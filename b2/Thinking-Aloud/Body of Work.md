I have written quite a lot in my life time. More than an average person anyway. This includes my botched attempts to writing various novels going as far back as 2003, _I Me Myself_ of 2005, the period of blogging between 2008 and... what 2013? A list of blogs which includes Talking Talking, Rajat's Diary, a WordPress.com blog, a Tumblr, and of course the early Blogger blogs.

This was followed by some long-form writing (> 5k words) in the form of _That Night_, letters to Tanya and Neha, and the pièce de résistance -- the IVP Memoirs in 2019. After that I've hardly written anything, unless you count some random shit in my diary, and that bug-busting story in CB.

All of this amounts to some 200,000 words _to the very least_. Still, as of today ()
